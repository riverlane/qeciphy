# QECIPHY Architecture

## Overview

QECIPHY is a high-speed serial communication protocol designed for reliable data transmission over multi-gigabit links between FPGAs from different product families. It implements automatic link establishment, frame alignment, error detection, and comprehensive error handling with AXI4-Stream compliant interfaces.

The aim of this module is to hide the complexity of high-speed serial communication using transceiver primitives and provide a simple interface for users to transmit and receive data across FPGAs with low latency, high reliability and minimal configuration.

## Clock Domains

**User Clocks:**
- `ACLK`: User AXI4-Stream interface clock
- `RCLK`: GT reference clock
- `FCLK`: Free-running fabric clock for internal logic

**Generated Clocks:**
- `tx_clk`: TX clock (Generated by GT from RCLK for 64-bit data)
- `tx_clk_2x`: 2x TX clock (synchronized to TX clock for 32-bit data)
- `rx_clk`: RX clock (Generated by GT through CDR for 64-bit data)
- `rx_clk_2x`: 2x RX clock (synchronized to RX clock for 32-bit data)

**Clock Relationships:**
- ACLK, RCLK, and FCLK can be asynchronous to each other
- TX clocks are derived from RCLK
- RX clocks are recovered from incoming data stream
- TX and RX clocks operate at the same frequency but are independent
- 2x clocks run at double the rate and are phase-aligned with their respective base clocks

## Implementation

This section aims to provide basic details of the key modules and their internal workings. To learn more, please refer to the individual module documentation in the source code.

### 1. Top-Level Module (QECIPHY.sv)

The top module that:
- Implements AXI4-Stream interfaces for user data
- Orchestrates all submodules

### 2. Reset Controller

The reset controller (`qeciphy_resetcontroller.sv`) manages the complex reset sequencing required for GT transceivers and datapath logic across multiple clock domains.

**Working Principle:**
- Waits for GT power good signal
- Provides 1250 cycle delay in FCLK domain
- Releases GT resets and waits for GT reset done signals
- Provides additional 32 cycle delay in ACLK domain
- Releases all datapath resets simultaneously
- Asserts reset sequence completion

**Cross-Domain Reset Synchronization:**
- State machine runs in ACLK domain
- Reset deassertion synchronized to each destination clock
- Prevents metastability during reset release

### 3. Link Controller

The link controller (`qeciphy_controller.sv`) manages the link establishment and state transitions based on status signals from the TX and RX paths.

**Key Features:**
- Monitors status signals from different modules
- Manages link state transitions
- Interfaces with TX and RX data paths for enable signals
- Maps the internal states to spec compliant link states

**Link Establishment Sequence:**
1. `RESET` -> IP in reset state
2. `WAIT_RESET_DONE` -> Wait for reset completion
3. `TX_LINK_ENABLE` -> Start transmitting alignment patterns
4. `WAIT_RX_DATAPATH_ALIGN` -> Wait for SERDES byte/word alignment
5. `RX_ENABLE` -> Start processing RX data
6. `WAIT_RX_LOCKED` -> Wait for local RX frame synchronization
7. `LOCAL_RX_LOCKED` -> Wait for remote RX frame synchronization
8. `BOTH_RX_LOCKED` -> Both ends synchronized
9. `TX_DATA_ENABLE` -> Enable user data transmission
10. `READY` -> Link is fully operational for bidirectional data

**Error Handling:**
- Fatal faults cause immediate transition to `FAULT_FATAL` state
- Fault state persists until system reset

### 4. TX Data Path

```
User AXI4-S -> TX FIFO -> TX Channel Encoder -> SERDES TX

TX Channel Encoder:
TX Boundary Gen -> TX Controller -> TX Packet Gen

SERDES TX:
TX 64b to 32b Serializer -> GT Primitive
```

**Flow Control:**
- Backpressure via `TX_TREADY` when TX FIFO is full or link is not ready
- User data is enabled only when link is established and remote is ready

#### 4.1 TX Controller
The TX controller (`qeciphy_tx_controller.sv`) manages transmission states:
   - Link Enable: FAW + CRC + Idle words
   - Data Enable: FAW + CRC + User data (or Idle if no data)

#### 4.2 TX Boundary Generator
The TX boundary generator (`qeciphy_tx_boundary_gen.sv`) creates timing signals for inserting boundary words.
   - FAW boundaries: Every 64 cycles (provides frame structure)
   - CRC boundaries: Every 7 cycles (for validation word insertion)

#### 4.3 TX Packet Generator
The TX packet generator (`qeciphy_tx_packet_gen.sv`) constructs the actual data packets to be sent over the link.
   - 3-stage pipeline for packet assembly
   - Inserts the following respecting TX controller mode:
     - Frame Alignment Words (FAW) at FAW boundaries
     - Validation Words (CRC) at CRC boundaries
     - Idle Words when no user data is available
   - Refer to the CRC implementation details below for validation word generation

#### 4.4 TX 64b to 32b Serializer
The TX 64b to 32b serializer (`qeciphy_tx_64b_to_32b.sv`) uses a toggle counter to alternate between upper and lower 32 bits of 64 bit data

### 5. RX Data Path

```
SERDES RX -> RX Channel Decoder -> RX FIFO -> User AXI4-S

SERDES RX:
GT Primitive -> RX Byte Aligner -> RX Word Aligner (32b to 64b)

RX Channel Decoder:
RX Boundary Gen -> RX Monitor -> User Data
```

**Flow Control:**
- Data is valid only when link is ready and valid user data is received
- RX FIFO overflow protection with error reporting

#### 5.1 RX Byte Aligner

The byte aligner (`qeciphy_rx_bytealigner.sv`) performs automatic byte alignment using slide control and comma detection (`0xBC` pattern every 128 32-bit words) through an 8-state FSM:
1. **IDLE**: Wait for slide ready from GT
2. **SLIDE0/SLIDE1**: Assert slide for 2 cycles
3. **OFF**: Deassert slide for 32+ cycles (GT requirement)
4. **CHECK**: Look for comma patterns; slide again if not found, otherwise proceed to REVIEW
5. **REVIEW**: Verify pattern stability
6. **DONE**: Alignment successful (sticky)
7. **FAIL**: Alignment failed after max attempts, restart process

#### 5.2 RX Word Aligner

The word aligner (`qeciphy_rx_32b_to_64b.sv`) creates two possible 64-bit combinations in `rx_clk_2x` domain:
   - **Option 0**: `{current_32b, previous_32b}`
   - **Option 1**: `{previous_32b, older_32b}`

FAW detection tests both options in `rx_clk` domain and locks onto the one showing valid FAW patterns.

#### 5.3 RX Controller
The RX controller (`qeciphy_rx_controller.sv`) manages the RX states and error handling:
   - Manages reception states:
      - Disabled: No data output
      - Enabled: Validated user data output
   - Latches RX errors until disabled

#### 5.4 RX Boundary Generator
The RX boundary generator (`qeciphy_rx_boundary_gen.sv`) uses an FSM to detect FAW patterns and generate timing signals:
   - 8-state FSM: RESET -> DISABLED -> ALIGN -> CHECK -> LOCKED -> FAW_START -> CRC_START -> OPERATIONAL
   - Searches for 7 consecutive valid FAWs before declaring lock
   - Generates synchronized timing for FAW and CRC validation

#### 5.5 RX Monitor
The RX monitor (`qeciphy_rx_monitor.sv`) validates and filters incoming data:
   - 11-stage pipeline for data processing
   - FAW error detection
   - CRC validation (Refer to CRC Implementation Details below)
   - Any detected errors are latched until the module is disabled
   - Remote RX lock detection
   - Filters out protocol overhead: Frame Alignment Words, Validation Words, and Idle Words; outputs only valid user data

### 6. Error Handler
The error handler (`qeciphy_error_handler.sv`) implements a comprehensive error management system:
- **Centralized Collection**: Aggregates errors from all subsystems
- **Fault Latching**: Errors persist until system reset

**Error Types:**
- FAW Error: Frame alignment issues
- CRC Error: Data integrity violations
- TX FIFO Overflow: Transmit buffer overflow
- RX FIFO Overflow: Receive buffer overflow

### 7. Clock Domain Crossing

The CDC module (`qeciphy_cdc.sv`) implements comprehensive CDC management across all the required clock domains.

All crossings use 2-FF synchronizers (`riv_synchronizer_2ff`) for metastability prevention.


### 8. CRC Implementation Details

The CRC subsystem provides multi-level error detection through a sophisticated pipelined architecture that operates concurrently with data processing.

#### 8.1 CRC Computation Engine
The CRC computation engine (`qeciphy_crc_compute.sv`) calculates four distinct CRC values over different segments of the data stream using a multi-channel pipelined design.
- **CRC01**: CRC16-IBM3740 protecting data words 0-1 
- **CRC23**: CRC16-IBM3740 protecting data words 2-3 
- **CRC45**: CRC16-IBM3740 protecting data words 4-5 
- **CRCVW**: CRC8-SMBUS protecting valid bits

**Staggered Operation:** Each CRC calculator operates with different enable and reset timing to ensure proper pipeline operation.

#### 8.2 CRC Validation Engine
The CRC validation engine (`qeciphy_crc_validate.sv`) verifies the computed CRC values against expected values received in validation packets.
   - **2-cycle pipeline** for CRC comparison
   - **Byte-wise comparison** to reduce combinational logic complexity
   - **Error latching** until next validation cycle
   - **Concurrent validation** of all four CRC values during CRC boundary cycles
