Instruction on how to setup the repository. Please overwrite this file with the real README

1. Modify the LICENSE.rst file adding the name of the software. 
```
Software: SOFTWARE_NAME
```

2. The current license model is MIT with common clause. Please discuss with the Engineering Steering Committee any need to modify that. 

3. All our public code must respect our quality policies. Exceptions can be discussed with members of the executive team.

4. Remove any vulgar, racial, offensive language from comments and code (applies to all languages not just english).

5. Run a review round with a senior developer before going public.

6. For product-oriented repositories, tests and documentation are a must before going public.

7. For science-oriented repositories, tests and documentation are strongly recommended before going public.
